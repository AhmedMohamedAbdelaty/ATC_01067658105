# Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Using Other Package Managers

This project uses `pnpm` as indicated by the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file. If you prefer to use `npm` or `yarn`:

1.  Delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.
2.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies with your chosen package manager.
3.  Replace `pnpm` in the commands above with `npm run` (e.g., `npm run dev`) or `yarn` (e.g., `yarn dev`).
